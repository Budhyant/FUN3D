## Fun3d Coupled Aeroelastic Simulation
I am running coupled aeroelastic simulation with fun3d's internal modal solver for the VIV problem. To run the problem, first go to the analysis folder and run `setup_files' script. This will copy the required fun3d files to the current folder. Next run `run_aeroelastic_internal` for the simulation.

I am still working on verifying the solution.
