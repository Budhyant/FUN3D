# FUN3D Tutorials
FUN3D is a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) suite of tools actively developed at NASA that benefits Aeronautics, Space Technology, and Exploration by modeling fluid flow.

When I started working with FUN3D (version 12.9), I noticed the lack of introductory tutorials. I decided to put together the test cases I have developed, hoping it helps other people learning FUN3D. For each case I will have a Python mesh generator script that generates the computational domain based on [Plot3D](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/wind/valid/plot3d.html) meshing convention. I will include a short tutorial on this as well. I will be writing the solution in the VTK format and I use [Paraview](http://www.paraview.org/) to visualize the results. As you have noticed, I am trying to use software packages that are freely available.
