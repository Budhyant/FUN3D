In this tutorial, I looked at motion of cylinder in domain due to some predefined path. To achieve this, I used two different methods defined by the `motion_driver` card in the `moving_body.input` file:
1. `forced_motion` is used to define a motion on a straight line or rotation of the boundary. A perdiodic motion can be also defined using this card. You can find examples on this in the [Forced](www.google.com) folder.
2. `motion_from_file` is used to define a motion based on a path defined in a file. The motion is defined at each time step based on a transformation defined in `*.hst` file. You can find examples on this in the [Motion_file](www.google.com) folder. For more information please refer to the FUN3D's user manual.
